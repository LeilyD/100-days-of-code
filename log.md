# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 5, 2021 


**Today's Progress**: Learning GitHub, Forking, Clonning, Committing and Pull Requests. 
* Solution for a challenge from [Dev.challenges.io.](https://devchallenges.io/)

**Thoughts:** I went through a lot of tutorials about GitHub functions, I struggled because many of them assumed that I already know the terminology that I just wasn't familiar with. However, I started to feel confident every time I succeed. having said that, I'll start by building some Websites with designs given by <>devChallenges.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
